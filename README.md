# CProjects
Past C languages projects

This folder contains a part of the projects I did during my first year at Epitech (IT French school).
I don't program in C language anymore but it's interesting to see the evolutions and have a grasp about the experience accumulated.
Epitech isn't a school like others. It's a self environment where students have to make their way through projects given every week.
With short deadlines and high disciplinary in a company like environment (your program crash? your grade is 0), it's not 3 years of school
I earn, but 3 years of working experience.

Some complementaries informations about those 1st year projects:

#Library
The library is our first project during the first month of Epitech.
The goal is to self reproduce the whole C library (strcmp, printf, strcat, strlen etc.) in order to integrate it in our future project.
The standard C libraries where (in 90% of cases) forbidden.
As you will see in the other folders, I always use them.

#corewar
The corewar project was the first group project of this first year.
A battle of programs in a virtual machine.

See "corewar_en.pdf"

#Allum-1 
This is a little game following the traditionnal Matches game. You start with 20 matches. The player who take the last one lose.

Individual project

#Minishell
The minishell is a linux command line interpretor. We had to build 2 versions of it in order to guide us to the final step: 42Sh.
I couldn't take my hand on my 42sh project, but you can have a grasp of the first step of it.

Individual project

#MiniTalk
The aim was to create a client / server chat. You simply had to communicate with a server and be able to manage an infinite string sent to the server.
With the best performances possible, of course ;)

Individual project

#RTV1
RTV1 is, as the minishell, the first step that drove us to the final project: create a 3D scene with a custom school library (minilibx).
This first step was the rendering of a sphere and a cylinder. With shadow and light projection.
